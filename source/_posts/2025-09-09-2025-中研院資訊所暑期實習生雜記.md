"Wait! But aren’t you a humanities student?"

As an anthropology student, it might seem unusual for me to do an internship at the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica. Whenever I tell people about it, they often get confused and ask why I’m not pursuing an internship more closely related to my major.

Since transferring to NTU last year, I’ve realized even more how strong my interest in anthropology is. I’ve always been fascinated by the diversity of human experiences when reading ethnographies about other cultures. Yet, I often ask myself—am I really meant to be an anthropologist?

Being an anthropologist isn’t easy. It requires long-term commitment and sustained effort. You must immerse yourself in communities for months or years, observe and participate without imposing your own biases, and navigate complex ethical situations that affect real people’s lives. At the same time, anthropologists are vulnerable—they must face their own limitations, emotions, and ethical dilemmas while trying to understand and represent others responsibly.

I spent the whole year questioning whether I truly had what it takes to follow this path, or if I should be pursuing other dreams—such as becoming a computer scientist. This uncertainty led me to apply for the internship at Academia Sinica, hoping it would give me a fresh perspective. Fortunately, I was accepted.

During my internship at Depositar Lab, I realized that my understanding of computer science—and of what it means to be a computer scientist—was quite limited. Computer science isn’t just about designing new algorithms; it also encompasses many aspects of the relationship between the real world and the digital world. 

For instance, this lab mainly deals with Research Data Management and Digital Preservation. It develops and uses open-source tools to help researchers from different disciplines share, preserve, and reuse their data more effectively. Much of this work is guided by the FAIR principles—ensuring that data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. This focus makes it quite different from many other labs, since it spans a wide range of fields and also has to address broader social issues such as privacy and intellectual property.

The director and the other members of the lab are not like the traditional stereotype of “geeks” who care little about politics or public issues, or who are too techno-optimistic to use technology without reflection. Instead, they approach their work with a strong sense of social responsibility, constantly questioning how digital infrastructures shape research practices and how technology can be designed with ethics and inclusivity in mind. 

This reminded me that disciplinary boundaries are not as natural or as fixed as I once imagined. A computer scientist can have a deep understanding of the humanities and apply it to her research; conversely, an anthropologist can acquire strong programming skills and use them to explore human behavior in new ways.

In the past, I often wondered which path I should follow—where my “true” discipline lies. But now, after seeing how knowledge, curiosity, and responsibility intersect across fields, I realize that the question is not about choosing a label.

I guess the real question isn't “Should I become an anthropologist or a computer scientist?” The point is: what do I really care about? I want to pursue work that goes beyond mere curiosity—something meaningful that connects people, ideas, and technology. And that is the challenge I must embrace in the next school year.
