目前就讀於國立臺灣大學人類學系二年級，對各個領域的知識領域抱持廣泛的好奇心，期望未來能從事跨學科的研究工作。我的主要興趣包括程式開發與語言學習，關注於科學技術與社會研究（Science, Technology, and Society, STS）、開放文化（open-source culture），以及跨文化視角下語言與認知之間的互動關係。\

I’m currently a second-year undergraduate student in the Department of Anthropology at National Taiwan University. I have a broad curiosity across disciplines and hope to become an interdisciplinary researcher in the future. My main interests include programming and learning different languages. Lately, I’ve been especially focused on Science, Technology, and Society (STS), open-source culture, and the interaction between language and cognition from a cross-cultural perspective.
